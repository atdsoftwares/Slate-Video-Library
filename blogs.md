# 10 VS Code Extensions to make you super productive developer

## Introduction

A Developer will have to spend a lot of time while developing products ,product development is an entire lifecycle where you have to counter errors and solve them to proceed further.

While solving errors it become very hectic to keep a track of the development phase in which you have to keep multiple things active such as development envrionment,file structure,configruations,databases,deployment etc.

To solve all these problems there are multiple tools available in the market but you can't predict which one is going to work for you or not ?

Hers is my Tech Stack :

* OS : Linux (Ubuntu)
* Code Editor : VSCode
* Terminal : WARP
* Programming Languages : JavaScript,TypeScript
* Front End : React JS,Next JS,React Native
* Backend :  NodeJS ,Express JS
* Scripting : Python,Bash
* Database :MongoDB,MYSQL
* Cloud : AWS
* Others : Appwrite
* Code : Github/Git
* Browser : Chrome
* Testing :Jest,Selenium
* Security Testing : Burp Suite
* Data Analysis : numpy,pandas,matplotlib,D3JS

As you can notice I deal with variety of tools to get my developer job done it becomes really hectic to manage various things on development .Here are my personal favorites VS Code Extensions which I use on daily basis to boost up my productivity and saves a lot of time .

## Auto Close Tag

Auto Close Tag is one of the most used extention in my daily development process as it helps to auto close the tags ,lets understand by an example suppose you have an html file and as per the standard starndrd you have to delcare the ``html`` tag at the top which starts with ``<html>` ``as the open tag is declared at the top it must have to be closed at the bottom like this `` ```</html>```` ``declaring everytime closing tags manualy consumes time specially in big files and sometimes it leads to errors if you forget to close the tag at the bottom.

This extension takes care about closing tags intelligently so you don't have to spend time .

## Auto Import

In big projects where multiple files,components,pages are used would have to linked to each other, if the file are not linked well with each other throws and immediate error and breaks the whole app, Auto Import works very well and takes care about it very well .
You can make pages ,components, files and simply delcare it on the places where its is required you will get an immediate prompt with the same page,components,files name just click on the prompt and you are good to go , you data is imported without manually confirguring the files.

## Console Ninja

Console Ninja my most favorite tool ,the tool allows you to directly see the ``console.log`` outputs into the Code editor itself without looking into the browser

## ES7 React Redux Snipet

This extension turbocharges your React development by providing shorthand snippets for common tasks. Instead of typing out boilerplate code for components, hooks, or Redux, you can generate it instantly with a few keystrokes, for examples Type `rfc` to create a React functional component template in seconds, saving time and reducing errors.

## Inttelicode

Microsoft's IntelliCode is an AI-powered tool that enhances your coding efficiency by providing intelligent code suggestions tailored to your unique coding style. It learns from your codebase and improves its recommendations over time, the example is  When writing a function, IntelliCode suggests the most relevant methods or properties, helping you code faster and more accurately.

## Thunder Client

Thunder Client is a lightweight REST API client integrated into VS Code, making it easy to test APIs directly within your development environment. It's fast, intuitive, and ideal for quick API testing without leaving your editor. Use Thunder Client to send GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE requests to your API endpoints and inspect the responses, all without switching to a separate tool.

## Turbo Console Log

Turbo Console Log automates the tedious process of adding console.log statements to your code, allowing you to quickly insert and manage logs with just a few commands. It's a huge time-saver for debugging.  Highlight a variable, and with a shortcut, Turbo Console Log will insert a `console.log` statement for it, making debugging swift and efficient.

## WakaTime

WakaTime is a time-tracking extension that gives you insights into your coding habits. It automatically tracks the time you spend on different projects, helping you understand where your efforts are going. Review your weekly WakaTime dashboard to see which languages, projects, and files consumed most of your time, allowing you to optimize your workflow.

## Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that ensures your code is consistently styled, no matter who wrote it. It automatically formats your code according to predefined rules, reducing stylistic debates and making your codebase cleaner. After writing a block of code, Prettier formats it on save, aligning indentations, fixing spacing, and making your code look polished.

## Colorize

Colorize enhances your CSS and JavaScript development by visualizing color values directly in your editor. It displays the actual color represented by a color code, making it easier to choose and adjust colors in your projects. example When working with `#ff5733`, Colorize instantly shows the color swatch beside the code, so you can see exactly what color youâ€™re working with.

## Conclusion

Tools are the friend of developers using it enhances the prodcutivity and saves the time resulting in better output and gives a chance to solely focus on other critical work.

If you have not started optimizing VSCode to the fullest you are leaving a good chance to save time and efforts .
